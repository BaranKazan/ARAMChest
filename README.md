**ARAMChest**

It's annoying when you can't see in ARAM if you have unlocked a chest for the picked champion, isn't it? Well, fear no more! I have created an API that requires the summoner name and region as input and it will return the name of the champion and if the summoner has unlocked the chest or not. The only thing that is left to do is creating a UI or a Discord bot instead.

You welcome Riot.😎
